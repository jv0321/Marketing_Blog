## Description
In this challenge, you will embark on creating a two-page website tailored for marketing students to express their thoughts and experiences through a personal blog. The project entails developing a content form where users can input their username, blog title, and blog content. Upon submission of the form, the blog post data will be stored locally using localStorage.

After submitting the form, users are redirected to the posts page where they can view a list of blog posts. The posts page includes a header with convenient features such as a light mode/dark mode toggle for customizing the page's appearance and a "Back" button for easy navigation back to the landing page to input more blog entries.

Each blog post displayed on the main content section is pulled from localStorage and presented in a structured format, including the post author's username, the title of the post, and the content. Users can click on individual blog entries to view detailed information such as the title, content, and author of the post.

Additionally, the footer of the application provides a link to the developer's portfolio, allowing users to explore more about the creator of the blog application. This personal blog platform aims to provide a user-friendly and interactive experience for individuals to express themselves and engage with the content shared by others.

This webpage was reformatted to satisfy the User's acceptance criteria when it came to their web page. The code was cleaned up and made more accurate. Slight adjustments were made to tags and elements to better fit in a uniform styled fashion with the image names. Comments were added to give clear indicators on specific sections of the code describing what each section is about.
